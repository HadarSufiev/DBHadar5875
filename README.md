## Phase 1: Design and Build the Database  

### Introduction

The **Nursery School Database** is designed to efficiently manage information related to children, parents, nannies, and nursery groups. This system ensures smooth organization and tracking of essential details such as group assignments, caregiver experience, child-parent relationships, and contact information.

#### Purpose of the Database
This database serves as a structured and reliable solution for nursery schools to:  
- **Organize groups** of children based on age, availability, and special needs.  
- **Manage caregiver assignments** by linking experienced nannies to specific groups.  
- **Maintain parent-child relationships**, ensuring smooth communication and accessibility.  
- **Store contact information**, including addresses, phone numbers, and emails.  
- **Track essential details** such as children's birthdates, allergies, and caregiver experience.  

#### Potential Use Cases
- **Nursery School Administrators** can use this database to efficiently allocate children to groups, assign caregivers, and store emergency contacts.  
- **Parents** can track their child's assigned group, caregiver details, and provide important information about allergies or special needs.  
- **Nannies** can view their assigned groups and the children under their care.  
- **Staff and Management** can use the system for record-keeping, scheduling, and communication.  

This structured database helps streamline nursery school operations, improving organization, safety, and communication among all parties involved.
